Operators:- 
        Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. 
        The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.
    1. Arithmetic
    2. Comparison
    3. Logical
    4. Bitwise Operators
    5. Special operators :- 1) Identity operators
                            2) Membership operators
    6. Assignment operators:- 

1) Arithmetic Operators :-
    Operator	Operation	    Description	
    +	    Addition	    Adds values on either side of the operator.	
    -	    Subtraction	    Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.	
    *	    Multiplication	Multiplies values on either side of the operator	
    /	    Division	    Divides left hand operand by right hand operand	
    %	    Modulus	        Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder	
    **	    Exponent    	Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators	
    //	    Floor Division	The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which
                            the digits after the decimal point are removed.

        ^	    XOR	                Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
        ~ 	    NOT	                Inverts all the bits
        <<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
